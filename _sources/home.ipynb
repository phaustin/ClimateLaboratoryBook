    "- **free** and **open** *(permissive license, sources and content available through github)*\n",
    "- **interactive** *(integration with JupyterHub and Binder will allow readers to run and modify code examples)*\n",
    "- a **living document** *(content will continue to evolve, and collaboration is welcome)*\n",
